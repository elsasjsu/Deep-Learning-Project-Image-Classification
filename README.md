# Deep-Learning-Project-Image-Classification
I'm building a smart system that can look at an image and tell me what's in it. For this project, I'm specifically teaching it to recognize 10 different types of objects, like a dog, a car, or a ship, using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
1. Teaching the System (The CNN):
I'm using a special type of AI called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Think of a CNN as a detective that's very good at spotting visual clues. First, it looks for simple clues like lines and edges. Then, it combines those to find more complex shapes, like a wheel or an ear. By the end, it has enough clues to identify the whole object. I built this detective system using two popular toolkits: PyTorch and TensorFlow. This shows I'm flexible and can work with different technologies.

2. Making it Smarter (Data Augmentation & Optimization):
Just like a human needs to see a cat from many angles to truly know what a cat is, I showed the AI system a bunch of different versions of the same imageâ€”some are flipped, some are slightly rotated. This process, called data augmentation, helped it learn better and improved its accuracy by 10%. I also used techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout to make the training process smoother and prevent the AI from "memorizing" the training images instead of learning from them.

3. Finding the Best Settings (Hyperparameter Tuning):
Every time I train the AI, there are certain "dials" I can turn, like the learning rate or the batch size, that affect how well it learns. Instead of guessing, I used an automated tool called Optuna to find the perfect combination of settings. This saved me a lot of time and helped me achieve a high accuracy of 92%.

4. Speeding it Up (GPU Training):
Training a deep learning model can take a long time. To speed up the process by 35%, I used a powerful graphics card (a GPU). GPUs are much better than regular computer processors at doing the kind of complex math needed for AI training.

5. Turning it into a Service (Flask and Docker):
After the AI was trained, it was just a file on my computer. To make it useful for others, I turned it into a web service.

Flask is a framework that let me create a simple website where someone could upload an image.

Docker is like a portable box that contains my application and everything it needs to run. I put my Flask app and the trained AI model inside this box. This means anyone can download my project and run it on their computer exactly the way I built it, without any setup issues. It's ready for real-time use at a large scale.
